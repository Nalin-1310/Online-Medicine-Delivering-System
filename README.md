# Flask Application Setup
This repository demonstrates a Flask-based web application built with Python 3.8. The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and MySQL as the back-end database.

## Project Overview
- **Operating System**: Windows family
- **Technology**: Python 3.8
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Back-End**: MySQL database
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Development IDE**: PyCharm

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure the following are installed on your system:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- MySQL database

To install flask on the system, we need to have python 2.7 or higher installed on our system. However, it is suggested using python 3 for the development in the flask.
Install virtual environment (virtualenv)
virtualenv is considered as the virtual python environment builder which is used to create the multiple python virtual environment side by side. It can be installed by using the following command.
1.	$ pip install virtualenv  
Once it is installed, we can create the new virtual environment into a folder as given below.
1.	$ mkdir new   
2.	$ cd new   
3.	$ virtualenv venv  
To activate the corresponding environment, use the following command on the Linux operating system.
1.	$ venv/bin/activate   
On windows, use the following command.
1.	$ venv\scripts\activate  
We can now install the flask by using the following command.
1.	$ pip install flask  
However, we can install the flask using the above command without creating the virtual environment.
